    "question": "What is Rever all about?",
    "header": "Rever was built with a simple question in mind: What if finance could feel clear again?",
    "body": "After a decade of working alongside CFOs and finance teams, our founders, Krishna and Mahesh, saw the same pattern repeating. As businesses scaled, finance grew more complex, reactive, and fragmented. What used to be a manageable, insightful function became bogged down by tools, processes, and decision fatigue.",
    "footer": "We created Rever to bring back the clarity, confidence, and control that finance teams deserveâ€”not by returning to the past, but by designing the future."

    "question": "Why We Started?",
    "header": "At Rever, we believe finance should be intelligent, empowering, and intuitive. We set out to build a copilot for finance, one that automates grunt work, surfaces real-time insights, ensures compliance by design, and brings everything together into a unified, intelligent system.",
    "body": "The mission? Free up finance teams to do what they do best: guide the business with clarity, foresight, and strategic impact.",

  {
    "question": "Where We're Headed?",
    "header": "We are building the operating system for modern finance, an AI-powered platform that enables teams to automate workflows, unify systems, and make better decisions, faster.",
    "body": "Rever is not just about removing friction. It's about unlocking flow in your processes, your systems, and your thinking.",
    "footer": "Bring clarity back to your finance team"
